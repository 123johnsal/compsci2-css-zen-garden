##Overview

The focus of this project is to have the students all start off with the same set of HTML code that they cannot alter. The student may only change the CSS.  
In completing this project, the students will see the amount a website can change just by altering the CSS.
  
### Starter code

There is an index.html file provided that should not be altered or changed EXCEPT to add IDs or Clases to elements.

###Assessment

1. Students will be assessed based on their performance in the project.

####1. Fork this repo.

**NOTE: It is common practice to push your changes to your GitHub repository often. It is recommended you make a push after every major change. Through the course of completing this project you should make 7-10 pushes to GitHub. Your teacher will be evaluating you on this.**

To push to GitHub run the following commands in your terminal:  
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`

#### 3. Fill out the CSS sheet.

During this project, the student is only manipulating the `style.css`.

###How to Submit
Students must push all final code to their GitHub repository. In order to push changes in Cloud 9, the following commands must be run in the terminal:

`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`  
 
**Students will then share their repository link on the class website bitly.com/mhscomputerscience.com**
